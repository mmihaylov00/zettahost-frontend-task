# Pacman
## Task Description
- Implement a version of the [Pacman Game](https://www.google.com/logos/2010/pacman10-i.html).
- The home page of the site is a "Main Menu" with a "Start" button and a leaderboard of the top 10 results and the usernames of the players who did them.
- When the "Start" button is clicked, the player is taken to the game screen. The game begins when the player presses any arrow key.
- When the player collects all points on the map, the game is restarted, but the player keeps his points.
- When the player dies, the game ends and a popup that prompts the player to enter his username is shown. When he clicks continue the data gets saved and  the player is redirected to the "Main Menu".
